<p>Music equipment FAQ:
<p>Q: How often should I have a piano tuned?
<p>A: I understand that sometimes life happens and your piano may go without tuning for a while.
That said, it is often cheaper in the long-run to maintain a piano regularly, and you then get the benefit of a much better sounding piano.
A better-sounding piano encourages more practice, which adds purpose to having a piano to begin with.
Refer below to the specific scenario matching your situation:
<ul>
	<li>Your piano hasn't been tuned in years. In this case your initial tuning will be more expensive, the piano will fall out of tune faster, and the tuning process is likelier to require associated repairs. Schedule a follow-up tuning a few months later, and after that you should apply one of the schedules below.
	<li>Your piano has been tuned in the last two years, is seldom or never played, hasn't been moved, and doesn't experience humidity or temperature shifts. Schedule tunings every 1-2 years.
	<li>Otherwise schedule tunings every 6 months to a year. If scheduling every 6 months, the absolute best times are in the middle of winter and the middle of summer.
</ul>
<p>Q: Why would you tune a piano that isn't being used?
<p>A: An acoustic piano is constantly under 10-24 tons of its own string tension, so it is stressed all the time. In addition, the wood in pianos is very sensitive to humidity and the steel is very sensitive to temperature, so the stresses are dynamic even if the piano isn't played.
<p>Q: I don't have money for regular tunings. What can you do for me?
<ul>
	<li>If you live in Syracuse, my minimum service cost is low.
	<li>I don't have to "fine-tune" your piano. As long as each string can be settled into the correct (if inexact) pitch, and any broken strings or pins are fixed, your piano will "keep" until you have resources for proper tuning and regulation. The piano will still sound better than it did before, and you'll save at least $20.
	<li>Keep your piano away from heat sources (vents, hot equipment, direct sun, etc.), and stick to a narrow temperature range near the piano.
	<li>Keep your piano away from humidity sources (kitchen, laundry, potted plants, etc.), and stick to about 50% humidity near the piano.
	<li>Avoid playing too hard.
	<li>Avoid moving your piano.
</ul>
<p>Q: Do acoustic pianos wear out? Should I buy this really old piano I found for free on Craigslist?
<p>A: It typically costs more than the price of a late-model used piano to make a 50+ year old piano sound really good.
In my opinion, when your goals for your piano's sound require replacing some component on every key of the instrument (ie all new hammers, all new strings, etc.) then your piano is likely totaled.
Another concern is that older pianos may be a habitat for dust, critters, droppings, etc.
Make sure you have affordable plans for both moving the piano in and out again if it doesn't work out.
For many people a reputable dealer is a better option.
<p>Q: What kind of piano should I get?
<p>A: Whatever makes you want to play the most! I own and enjoy both electronic and acoustic instruments. The following may inform your decision:
<ul>
	<li>Think twice about small "spinet" uprights where the hammers are below the keys.
These often have inferior feel and tone and are harder to service.
If you want a small sound, instead consider a digital piano or stuffing foam in the back of a bigger upright.
	<li>Grand pianos, including baby grands, have a mechanical action that is faster than upright action.
Bigger grand pianos with longer strings have less tonal enharmonicity for purer sound.
I don't have one because I prefer alternating between several computer-modeled grand pianos using an electronic instrument. However, if you have space for it and access to a technician qualified in servicing these, a well-maintained grand piano is a glorious thing.
	<li>Larger upright pianos are a good compromise in terms of cost, playability, portability, and maintenance costs.
I service these.
	<li>For new digital pianos with good action, sound, and a usable service network, I recommend anything in the Yamaha Clavinova family.
In my opinion, used digital pianos are worth considering only if you know of someone nearby who can service them.
A digital piano is highly recommended for families where volume control is required.
	<li>You can also build your own digital instrument using a MIDI controller, computer, pedals, and speakers.
Your setup may rival a grand piano in terms of playability, approach a grand piano in terms of sound, and greatly exceed any acoustic instrument in terms of tonal flexibility and control.
A well set up digital piano is an excellent tool for creating <a href="recording.html">clean recordings.</a>
I can divert lesson time to offer some pointers on how to build and program something like my setup, but it is a time-intensive process best left to the electronic music enthusiast.
</ul>
<p>Q: What features should a piano have?
<p>A: 88 keys (a few "clunker" keys in the top or bottom octaves is OK) and a working sustain pedal are required for lessons.
You need to be able to sit with proper posture at the piano, so a piano bench with height adjustment is also required (sometimes stacked carpet samples can work).
Digital pianos require a "weighted action."
While not required, having three working pedals is highly recommended on any piano.
For electric pianos, a USB MIDI output is highly recommended.
<p>Q: What ukulele should I get?
<p>A: A few options...
<ul>
	<li>Go to a store with lots of ukuleles (ie Dietze Music) and try every soprano and concert ukulele you can afford.
During lesson time, I can train you to evaluate store ukuleles.
Cheaper ukuleles have fairly abysmal quality control in my experience, but with a bit of hunting you can usually find a gem for less than $100.
	<li>I could keep your loaner ukulele security deposit and you could keep your loaner uke.
These typically have better strings, tuning machines, and intonation than new ukuleles in the same price range.
	<li>If you bought or inherited an ukulele that is just not cutting it, I service soprano and concert ukuleles and can often improve them from factory condition.
</ul>
<p>Q: Why are instruments so expensive?
<p>A: It can be daunting to start an instrument that can cost a month's earnings (or more!), but fortunately used pianos are affordable for anyone with access to strong friends, a truck, and a nearby piano technician (like me!).
The only equipment that defines your musicianship is between your ears.
Happy practicing!
