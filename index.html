<p>My name is Mr. McKelvey, and I teach piano in Otoe County.
<p>My lessons...
<ul>
  <li>...compliment students' other extracurricular activities
  <li>...build responsibility, critical thinking, and artistry
  <li>...include ukulele instruction to cater to different learning styles
</ul>
<p>Other than the first lesson of every month, all lessons are over the Internet because...
<ul>
  <li>...it is efficient use of everyone's time
  <li>...one in-person lesson a month covers what can't be taught online
  <li>...it allows two short (12-1/2 minute) lessons a week to give improved learning outcomes
</ul>
<p><a href="requirements.html">Here</a> is what you'll need to get started!
