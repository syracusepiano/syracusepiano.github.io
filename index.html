<p>Welcome to Syracuse Piano!
<p>My lessons compliment other extracurricular activities, cater to different learning styles, and build responsibility, critical thinking, and artistry.
<p>Lessons are online other than the first lesson of each month, which covers what isn't efficiently taught online.
This allows two 12-1/2 minute lessons a week to help students absorb material and pace their practicing better.
<p>You can request a few <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSOYnmueS83UDyDbFzz0atItDtpa-YYkkD3Z5peiM2dPiW3A/viewform">lesson times</a>
after going over what you need to <a href="requirements.html">get started.</a>
<p>In addition to lessons, I also
<a href="equipment.html">tune and maintain musical equipment</a>
and
<a href="recording.html">produce recordings.</a>
